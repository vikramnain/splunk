First you have to place your TA in /opt/splunk/etc/shcluster/apps/
Make sure splunk has access to your TA. Check permissions.
You can change by chown -R  splunk:splunk TA-app-for-splunk
If you logged in as root change it to splunk user
sudo su - splunk 
change directory to /opt/splunk/bin
apply sh cluster with following command
./splunk apply shcluster-bundle -target https://<SH IP>:8089 -preserve-lookups true
